          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>Working with Compliance to approve content should be straightforward, but it’s often not. Complex procedures, documentation requirements, and understanding who does what (and when) can be overwhelming, even for seasoned professionals. A traditional solution has been a lengthy, one-size-fits-all course. This strategy can work but it can feel irrelevant for experienced professionals and frustrating for newer ones looking for immediate answers. Meanwhile, support teams field repeated questions about the process that a smarter solution could handle.</p>

          <h2>The Insight</h2>
          <p>Instead of developing another static course, I started by asking the question: "What if the learning experience met users at their moment of need?" With recent advances in AI, I realized I could prototype a conversational coach that adapts to the user’s level and questions.</p>

          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <p><strong>ACE</strong> was born: An AI-powered digital coach designed to deliver efficient, contextualized guidance on the Compliance process—without requiring learners to wade through irrelevant content.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Delivers just-in-time support based on real user queries</li>
            <li>Reduces reliance on long-format courseware for ongoing knowledge</li>
            <li>Improves efficiency and engagement by skipping what's irrelevant</li>
            <li>Creates a scalable, extensible framework for future AI learning tools</li>

          <h2>The Reflection</h2>
          <p>ACE demonstrates how learning designers can leverage AI not just to build content (generative AI), but also to create support systems that evolve alongside the learner. This project also helped me hone my full-stack prototyping skills while staying grounded in what matters: solving real problems for real users.</p>
